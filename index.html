                  Cyrus is a renowned international thief who leads a heist crew consisting of Denton, pilot Camila, hacker Mi-Sun, safecracker Magnus, and engineer Luke. They pull off two simultaneous thefts: stealing a Van Gogh painting in London and staging the fake kidnapping of famous NFT artist N8 in Venice. The stolen painting is sold on the black market for $20 million to purchase N8’s NFTs. After the “kidnapping,” N8’s NFT value skyrockets to $89 million.
                  Interpol agent Abby Gladwell, Cyrus’s former romantic interest, gathers evidence implicating Denton in the theft and arrests him. However, instead of prosecuting the crew, Abby’s superior, Commander Huxley, coerces them into helping capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson. Jorgenson plans to profit from a massive flooding in Europe orchestrated by the hacker group Leviathan. The crew devises a daring plan to steal $500 million in gold bullion from a passenger plane in mid-air to prevent Jorgenson’s scheme.
                  This film combines elements of action, comedy, and crime, offering a thrilling ride with a touch of humor and romance.

                <p class="card-text text-start ">
                  “El Conde” is a darkly comedic and satirical film that takes a unique approach to the historical figure of Augusto Pinochet, reimagining him as a centuries-old vampire. The film traces his journey from a French soldier to a feared dictator in Chile, all while maintaining his vampiric nature. As the story unfolds, we see Pinochet, now known as “The Count,” grappling with the loss of his will to live after 250 years. His family, eager for their inheritance, and his loyal butler, who is also a vampire, become central to the plot as they navigate the complexities of their existence.
                  The film takes a turn when a nun named Carmen is hired to audit the family’s wealth but is revealed to have ulterior motives. Her interactions with Pinochet lead to unexpected consequences, further entangling the characters in a web of power, desire, and immortality. “El Conde” premiered at the Venice International Film Festival, winning acclaim for its screenplay, and later received an Oscar nomination for its cinematography. Its release on Netflix coincided with the historical anniversary of Pinochet’s rise to power, adding a layer of significance to its reception.

                <p class="card-text text-start">
                  Sex Education is a British teen sex comedy drama television series created by Laurie Nunn for Netflix. It follows the lives of teenagers and adults in the fictional town of Moordale as they contend with various personal dilemmas, often related to sexual intimacy. The ensemble cast includes characters like Otis Milburn, a student at Moordale Secondary School, who begins the series ambivalent about sex due to his single mother, Jean Milburn, being a sex therapist. Other key characters include Maeve Wiley, an intelligent and rebellious teen; Eric Effiong, Otis’s best friend and the gay son of Ghanaian-Nigerian immigrants; and Adam Groff, the headmaster’s son who struggles with self-loathing. The show explores themes of relationships, sexuality, and personal growth, all set against the backdrop of a school sex therapy clinic that Otis and Maeve set up.
                  In the third season, the students return to school after summer break, and the new headteacher, Ms. Hope Haddon, introduces strict rules and regulations. The tension between Otis and Maeve continues, and the students witness public humiliation, leading to Hope’s resignation. However, their protest has unintended consequences, jeopardizing the school’s future. Meanwhile, Otis and Maeve finally come together, but Maeve’s acceptance into a program in the United States becomes a hurdle.
